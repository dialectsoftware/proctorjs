[ProctorJS](https://www.proctorjs.com/) provides a policy-based isolation framework into which you can load third-party components and plugins. These components are loaded into their own scopes without access to global variables, except those variables which you explicitly allow.

You can provide access to global variables and objects with exclusion filters or create custom contexts through which components can interact with your content. You can also use custom policies to manage which methods and properties code can access. Visit [https://www.proctorjs.com](https://www.proctorjs.com/) for more details.
